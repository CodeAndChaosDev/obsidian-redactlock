# 📝 Patch Notes – Version 0.1-alpha

> Initial alpha release of **Obsidian RedactLock**  
> Date: [2025-05-28]

---

## ✅ Features

- 🔒 **Redacted Content Blocks**  
  Use a custom ` ```redact ` code block to hide sensitive text in Obsidian preview mode.

- 🔓 **Password-Protected Reveal**  
  Requires entering the master password (`letmein`) to reveal hidden content.

- 🔁 **Toggle Visibility**  
  Once revealed, users can click again to redact the content without re-entering the password.

- 🧩 **Markdown Code Block Integration**  
  Seamlessly integrates into Obsidian's Markdown flow with no extra formatting needed.

---

## 🛠 Developer Notes

- **Master password is hardcoded** for now (`letmein`) – defined in `main.ts`.
- Password prompt is handled via `PasswordModal.ts` (custom modal class).
- Plugin output files are stored in the `plugin/` folder (ready to copy into Obsidian).

---

## 📌 Known Limitations

- 🔐 Password is hardcoded (no UI for user-defined password yet).
- ⚠️ No encryption — content is only hidden in UI, not secure against file inspection.
- 🧪 Alpha version — not tested across all Obsidian themes or mobile.

---

## 🛣 Planned for Next Releases

- [ ] Add plugin settings tab to set/change master password.
- [ ] Optional timeout to auto-hide content after reveal.
- [ ] Optional blur-style redaction instead of full hide.
- [ ] Per-block custom passwords.
- [ ] (Optional) Basic encryption for local content.

Stay tuned for updates — and thank you for testing the alpha release!
