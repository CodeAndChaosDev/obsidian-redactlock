# 📝 Patch Notes – Version 0.2-alpha

> Second alpha release of **Obsidian RedactLock**
> Date: 2025-05-29

---

## ✅ Features

* ⚙️ **Plugin Settings Panel**
  Added a settings tab in Obsidian preferences where users can:

  * Set and update the master password.
  * Toggle auto-redaction behavior.
  * Define a timeout delay in seconds.

* ⏱️ **Auto-Redact Timeout**
  When enabled, revealed content is automatically re-redacted after a user-defined number of seconds.

* 🔁 **Manual Re-Redaction**
  Once content is revealed, clicking it again will hide it — without re-entering the password.

---

## 🛠 Developer Notes

* Settings managed via `@setting-tab.ts` and persisted using Obsidian’s `PluginSettingTab`.
* Password now stored in plugin settings (no longer hardcoded).
* Timeout and toggle options handled internally with clean state checks.
* Code structure reorganized for modularity and extensibility.

---

## 📌 Known Limitations

* 🔐 Password is still **global** — no per-block password support yet.
* ⚠️ Content is still only visually hidden — **no encryption**.
* 🧪 Timeout does not pause or reset on hover/interaction.

---

## 🛣 Planned for Next Releases

* [ ] Per-block custom passwords.
* [ ] Optional blur-style redaction instead of full text removal.
* [ ] Encryption-based local protection (basic AES).
* [ ] Global "lock all" and "unlock all" commands.
